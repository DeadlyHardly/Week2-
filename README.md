# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

Automated AI-powered plant disease detection system for sustainable agriculture.

## Quick Summary
This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that automatically classifies crop diseases from leaf images.  
It helps farmers detect diseases early, reduce pesticide usage, and support sustainable agriculture.

## Dataset
PlantVillage dataset (Kaggle) — contains images of healthy and diseased leaves.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy / Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Results
Achieved 90%+ accuracy on validation data after training for 10 epochs.

## Sustainability Focus
Early disease detection → Reduced chemical use → Better yields → Food security 🌱
